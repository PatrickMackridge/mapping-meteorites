# Meteorites: Maps and More!

Welcome to the repository for my meteorite data visualisation React app. The data comes courtesy of NASA, using their [Open Data Portal meteorite data](https://data.nasa.gov/Space-Science/Meteorite-Landings/gh4g-9sfh) via [The Socrata Open Data API (SODA)](https://data.nasa.gov/resource/gh4g-9sfh.json).

This app started life as a two day sprint I did whilst at Northcoders coding bootcamp. Originally it was the result of me and another Northcoders student pairing, before I forked it to complete the app in my own time over the next few weeks.

The hosted version can be found here: http://PatrickMackridge.github.io/meteorite-landings

Alternatively, see below for instructions on how to run this repo locally on your machine!

The data visualisation includes maps, tables and charts, and was done using a combination of:

- react-leaflet
- react-leaflet-heatmap-layer
- react-chartjs-2

I would strongly recommend all of the above libraries for anyone interested in JavaScript data visualisation.
